# Artha vs. Traditional Trading Spreadsheets

For decades, the standard advice for traders was: "Keep a spreadsheet." While better than nothing, manual spreadsheets are increasingly becoming a bottleneck for serious traders.

Let's look at why automated journaling is the new standard.

## 1. Friction vs. Flow

The biggest problem with spreadsheets is **Friction**. You have to manually type in the ticker, entry price, exit price, commission, and time. 

After a long day of trading (or a particularly red day), most traders simply don't have the discipline to fill out a spreadsheet. Artha removes this friction entirely with **Auto-Sync**.

## 2. Accuracy and Data Integrity

Human error is inevitable. A typo in a spreadsheet can ruin your P&L calculations for the entire month. Artha pulls data directly from your broker, ensuring your FIFO P&L, commissions, and fees are accurate down to the cent.

## 3. Psychological Depth

A spreadsheet is a flat record of numbers. Artha is a record of your **mind**. 

While you *could* add a column for "Emotions" in Excel, Artha's interface is designed specifically to capture your mental state at the time of the trade. Our "Psychology Insights" engine then connects those emotions to your bank account, showing you the literal cost of Greed or Fear.

## 4. Time to Insight

With a spreadsheet, you have to build your own formulas, charts, and pivot tables to find a "leak." 

Artha does the heavy lifting for you. The moment your trades sync, your Win Rate, Profit Factor, and R:R ratios are updated. You spend less time engineering data and more time engineering your growth.

## The Verdict

If you are a hobbyist taking one trade a week, a spreadsheet might suffice. But if you are a serious trader looking to identify patterns and achieve professional consistency, **Artha is the upgrade you need.**
