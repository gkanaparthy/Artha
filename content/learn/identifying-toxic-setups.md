# The 'Silent Killer' of Trading Accounts

Most traders believe they need a higher win rate to be more profitable. In reality, most traders just need to stop taking the trades that don't work for them.

We call these **Toxic Setups**.

## What is a Toxic Setup?

A toxic setup is a specific type of trade that consistently results in a loss for you, even if it "looks good" on paper or works for other traders. It might be a specific time of day, a certain volatility level, or a technical pattern like "Buying the Dip" during a parabolic move.

## Why They Are Silent Killers

Toxic setups are dangerous because they are often buried among your winning trades. You might have a 60% win rate, but if your toxic setups have a 10% win rate and larger loss sizes, they are silently eating all your profits from your "Golden Setups."

## How to Identify Them

To find your toxic setups, you need granular data:

- **Setup Tagging:** Use Artha to tag every entry (e.g., "Breakout," "Mean Reversion," "Trend Follow").
- **Win Rate by Tag:** Check your Artha reports to see the win rate and P&L for each specific tag.
- **The Filter Test:** Filter your dashboard to EXCLUDE your worst-performing tag. Does your equity curve suddenly look 2x better? If so, you've found your toxic setup.

## The Artha Edge

Artha's automated syncing makes this analysis effortless. Instead of spending hours in a spreadsheet, you can see your Setup Performance in seconds. 

By eliminating just one toxic setup, you can often double your monthly profitability without changing anything else about your trading.
