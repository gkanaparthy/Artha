        question: "Is there a free trial?",
        answer: "Yes! Every new user gets a full 30-day free trial of Artha Pro. You can cancel anytime before the trial ends to strictly avoid being charged. After that, choose between monthly ($12/mo founder pricing) or annual plans, or grab lifetime access for a one-time payment. Early adopters who signed up before subscriptions launched are grandfathered into Pro free forever."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from other trading journals?",
        answer: "Most journals just track P&L. Artha tracks your psychology. Tag every trade with setups (Breakout, Support Bounce), mistakes (FOMO, Revenge Trade), and emotions (Fear, Greed, Focused). Then see your 'Behavioral Alpha' - exactly how much your mistakes cost you and which setups actually make money."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you support options trading?",
        answer: "Yes! Full options support including standard and mini options, with proper contract multipliers (100x and 10x). P&L is calculated using FIFO matching across your entire position history."
